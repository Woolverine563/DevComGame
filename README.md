### Game Description:
The major inspiration for this game was Rocket League. We tried to implement its core features but in a 2D top down mode. It is essentially a 2P local mutiplayer game. The first player to score 5 points wins. We have tried to make the game fast-paced and replayable. Thanks for Playing!!! <3



### How to Play?
